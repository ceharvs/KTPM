# Kidney Transplant Process Model (KTPM)
## By: Christine Harvey

The Kidney Transplant Process Model (KTPM) was built using data from the
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Database.  This system was
developed by UNOS and contains all OPTN data related to every organ donation
and transplant event in America since 1987.  Statistics taken from this
database as well as from OPTN reports were used to generate and then validate
the model.


The purpose of the Kidney Transplant Process Model (KTPM) is to demonstrate
and the kidney transplant process, from the initial waiting list to the
post-transplant survival observations.  In particular, this model focuses
on the effects of increased organ availability on the entire transplant
process.  Thousands of Americans die every year waiting for a transplant.
This model is a tool that can provide analysis for the effects of increased
organ availability.  Increases in living and/or deceased donor transplants can
be simulated and the resulting survival rated can then be analyzed.  This model
 includes a specific focus on patient age and ethnicity.
